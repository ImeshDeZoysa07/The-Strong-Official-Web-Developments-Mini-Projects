# Typesettings.css
Typesettings.css is a lite design system for minimal website or article design, inspired by traditional graphic design fundamentals. No colors; no Javascript; no classes required! In version 2.x, the typography scales bigger, the design goes bolder, & contrast gets stronger.

## Basic Usage
### 1. Include typesettings.css in the HTML file's `<head>` section:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="[path]/typesettings.css">
</head>
```

Note: If you are using typesettings.css as is, don't combine it with other frameworks. Also, basic resets are included, there is no need to use Normalize.css or Sanitize.css.

### 2. Add `data-typesettings` attribute to the direct child element of the `<body>`:

```html
<body>
  <div data-typesettings>
    â€¦
  </div>
</body>
```
